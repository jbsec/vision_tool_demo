# ðŸ‘“ VISION ðŸ‘“ - Interactive Demo V0.0.1
## VISION: Visual Interface for SHAP Interpretation and Ongoing Navigation
### SHAP-XAI Powered collective local explanation timeline tool.

VISION is a SHAP-powered local instance investigation tool for time series predictions. The value in this tool is that SHAP investigates global, and LIME investigates local. This tool combines LIME-esque explanations into an interactive timeline for sythentically generated data in a random forest time series forecast. VISION is a powerful tool that improves upon the existing LIME XAI library, whereas previously to investigate several specifc instances of a prediction, you would need a never-ending page of LIME output, VISION allows for an interactive view of local explanations in a user-friendly interface.
